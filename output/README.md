Output
=====================
Folder where all the images produced are saved (each folder has particular subset of
the images saved, explained in the corresponding folders). All the images produced in
this root directory are final results of the test, i.e. the final clustering results or
the ground truth (if running an SBM test rather than the final blockchain trial)
