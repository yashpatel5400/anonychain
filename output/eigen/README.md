Eigen
=====================
Values of both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, although the latter is more crucial. More to
get a conceptual grasp on the idea of spectral clustering in seeing the distinct jumps that 
occur over the components of the eigenvector. Note that the eigenvectors displayed are ALL the
2nd least eigenvector, with the trailing number indicating on which round of partitioning the
corresponding eigenvector was found
