Contraction
=====================
The results of the contraction trials, i.e. linear regressions on the clustering accuracies
of trials as functions of the percent of edges contracted. These are conducted over
different combinations of p,q and were originally done using uniform contraction (later
expanded to spectral contraction in realizing suboptimal performance)
