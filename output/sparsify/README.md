Sparsify
=====================
Folder where the results of sparsification are stored, typically displaying the
original and sparse complementaries of a given graph. Used to demonstrate how much simpler
the final output is, while retaining some semblance of the original (what "semblance"
depends on the type of sparsification employed)
